# CST8100 Assignment 4 - Arrays
This was the fourth assignment I created in my "Intro to Computer Programming" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, the program allows the user to move a turtle in a two-dimsenial 20x20 grid. The turtle can move up, right, down, or left and use a pen to leave a trail. The user will be told when they cannot move any further in that direction and can have the turtle pick up his pen to no longer leave a trail. Presented with a menu, the user can choose to see the grid, thus showing the turtle's location, or reset the grid, which resets the turtle to his 0,0 position and removes any trails drawn by the turtle's pen.

This assignment introduced me to arrays, as the grid makes use of a two-dimensional array of integers. The only assistance given by my professor was drawing the grid. Assigning the location a value of "1" results in that position having an asterisk, the result of the turtle using his pen to draw a trail. Boundaries are checked and messages are displayed to the user telling them that they have reached a boundary. I also made a message appear using a boolean on whether or not they pick up or put down the turtle's pen if the pen is already up or down.
