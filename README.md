# CST8100-Assignment-4
This was the fourth assignment I created in my "Intro to Computer Programming" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, the program allows the user to move a turtle in a two-dimsenial 20x20 grid. The turtle can move up, right, down, or left and use a pen to leave a trail. The user will be told when they cannot move any further in that direction and can have the turtle pick up his pen to no longer leave a trail.

This assignment introduced me to arrays, as the grid makes use of a two-dimensional array of integers. The only assistance given by my professor was drawing the grid. Assigning the location a value of "1" results in that position having an asterisk, the result of the turtle using his pen to draw a trail. Boundaries are checked and messages are displayed to the user telling them that they have reached a boundary. I also made a message appear using a boolean on whether or not they pick up or put down the turtle's pen if the pen is already up or down.
